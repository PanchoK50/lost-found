# Lost & Found: talk to your building

Team Lost & Found, Industrial Agents Hackathon 2026, Track 01 "Talk to Your Building".

You give it a building in the kit format. People ask in plain language (typed or spoken), and every answer is computed
exactly from the plan and shown on a 3D model of the building:
- where things are
- routes: step-free, for a wide load or a forklift, around closures, tours
- areas, rooms above and below, shared walls
- what-if changes and emergencies

**The benchmark submission is in [`SUBMISSION/`](SUBMISSION/):** [`BENCHMARK.md`](SUBMISSION/BENCHMARK.md) holds the
run command; `answers.json` holds the answers to the 145 test questions (Claude Opus 5.5, effort low).

## Architecture

            Python agent API (lostfound/api, FastAPI) ── Claude Opus 5.5 (Anthropic API, tool use)
                                                            │  Claude only picks a tool and fills in its arguments

            deterministic core (lostfound/core) ─── building.json (kit format; any building, nothing hard-coded)
              route graph · geometry · reach · edits     route model = the kit's starter_agent/building_map.py
```

- **Claude understands, the code computes.** Room, floor and item mentions are resolved to ids in code. Claude Opus 5.5
  then picks one of 15 typed tools: route, nearest, largest room, total area, errand, delivery and step-free
  reach, above/below, shared walls, 3D distance, what-if door, search, find and count items. Every number, room and route comes from
  the tool. For questions no tool covers, Claude writes a short Python snippet against the same library. The final
  `Answer:` line is copied from the tool result.
- **One route model.** Routing uses exactly the kit's distance model: door to door 15 cm off the walls, around corners,
  stairs 2 m per metre climbed, lifts 15 m plus 1 m per metre. On top of it come the organizers' rules: step-free
  routes, closures, minimum door width, forklifts (openings of 3 m or more, no stairs or lifts, production bays only
  as start or destination), and "no route" when none exists.
- **The building can change by conversation.** Edits are kept per session and replayed the same way in Python and
  TypeScript: close or reopen, add or move a door, door width, rename, room type, move an item, storey height,
  rescale.
- **New buildings from plans** (`lostfound/ingest`): SVG or PNG floor plans become a `building.json`. Raster outlines
  are straightened, the scale is estimated from typical room sizes, and storey heights are set by building type.
- **Emergencies** (`lostfound/hazards`): the spread of fire, water and electrical incidents, the people affected,
  evacuation routes and fire-brigade attack routes. All of it is derived from `building.json` alone.
- **Across buildings:** journeys from a room in one building to a room in another, through the best exit and
  entrance. These use real OpenStreetMap positions or a placement the user gives in chat.

## Run it

```sh
uv sync
cp .env.example .env                       # ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (also ELEVENLABS_*, SUPABASE_* for the web app)

# benchmark: building folder (or folder of buildings) + questions -> answers.json
uv run --env-file .env python -m lostfound.run_benchmark data/test data/test/questions.csv answers.json

# agent API on :8000, then the web app on :3000 (web keys go in website/.env.local)
uv run --env-file .env uvicorn lostfound.api.server:app --port 8000
cd website && npm install && npm run dev
```

## Checks

- `uv run pytest`: over 6,400 tests. They include:
  - every labelled train/dev answer through the official scorer
  - warm-up routes to the centimetre
  - disguised copies of buildings (new ids, moved, reordered) to catch overfitting
  - all 40 test buildings checked against the kit's router
  - an independent reimplementation of the geometry rules from this README
  - forklift and bay rules
  - the submission format
- Dev benchmark with the Opus agent: 138/138. Paraphrased dev questions: 276/276. Results are in
  [`evals/results/summary.md`](evals/results/summary.md).

The challenge kit's own README follows unchanged: data, route model, question kinds, submission format.

# Track 01 — Google Maps for Every Building: student kit

Build a conversational agent that knows a building as well as its facility manager does. You give it a building, and people just ask it things:

- *"Where is the 3D printer?"*
- *"How do I get from the lobby to the CNC mill on floor 2 without stairs?"*
- *"The east lift is closed for maintenance. What changes?"*
- *"Add a door between rooms 2.03 and 2.04."*

This kit has everything you need to start:

- **Data:** 280 buildings with floor plans, equipment lists and plan images.
- **Questions:** train and dev questions with answers, and the test questions you are scored on (without answers).
- **A working starter agent** built on the Claude API.
- **A scorer**, so you can measure yourself on dev before you submit.

---

## 1. The challenge

### Levels (each builds on the previous)

1. **Locate:** one floor; find things and show them.
2. **Route:** A to B on one floor, step-free routes, closed areas, multi-stop tours.
3. **Scale:** several floors, then several buildings, with stairs, lifts and walkways.
4. **Build:** create or update a building from floor plans, by conversation, in minutes.
5. **Extend (optional, pick one and do it well):** moving assets, several users, industrial logistics (forklift routes, blocked aisles), capture on site with a phone, accessibility routing, presentation (isometric floors, animated routes, voice), or an AR overlay.

The brief recommends this architecture. The **agent** is the conversation layer: it understands the person and calls tools. The **core** should be deterministic: a graph of rooms, doors, corridors, stairs and lifts, plus locatable assets, and a shortest-path search. Agree on your data model early, and get one question working end to end before you build any 3D or a pretty UI.

### Judging

| Part | Points | What counts |
|---|---|---|
| Does it work | 55 | An automatic check on unseen buildings and questions (levels 1–4): correct answers, valid routes, route length vs. the optimum, buildings built correctly from plans. **Your test-set submission (section 6) is part of this.** |
| Interaction | 25 | A scripted conversation with tricky users. The agent asks only what it needs, shows what it understood, and gives directions people can follow. |
| Creativity | 10 | Level 5 and add-ins. |
| Pitch and demo | 10 | A 3–5 minute live demo that works without a restart. |

Shortly before code freeze on Sunday, a new, unseen building is released, and your agent has to find optimal routes in it. Don't tune to the test buildings. Build something that works on any building in this format.

## 2. What's in the kit

```
README.md                  this file
CHANGELOG.md               what changed between kit versions (1.1.0: stair and lift costs)
ATTRIBUTION.md             data sources and licences (read before you share anything)
pyproject.toml             Python project for the starter agent and the scorer (uv or pip)
.env.example               copy to .env and add your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
starter_agent/             a working example agent (Claude + tools); its own README explains it
benchmark/                 score.py (the official scorer) and evaluate.py (runs an agent, writes the submission)
data/
  manifest.csv             one row per building: split, source, licence, size, lifts, stairs, ...
  train/<building_id>/     200 buildings: plan, equipment, images, questions with answers
  dev/<building_id>/       40 buildings: same as train; use for self-evaluation
  test/<building_id>/      40 buildings: plan, equipment, images, questions WITHOUT answers
  test/questions.csv       all 145 test questions in one table
  test/submission_template.csv   question_id,answer with every test id, ready to fill in
```

Each building directory contains:

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `building.json` | The plan in the common format (section 3) |
| `equipment.csv` | One row per piece of furniture, fixture, machine or piece of equipment |
| `floor_<level>.png` / `.svg` | Plan with furniture |
| `floor_<level>_plain.png` | Plan without furniture |
| `questions.jsonl` | Benchmark questions. Answers are included in train and dev, not in test. |
| `questions_basic.jsonl` | Warm-up questions with answers (train and dev only) |

| Split | Buildings | Benchmark questions | Warm-up questions |
|---|---|---|---|
| train | 200 | 517 | 1,761 |
| dev | 40 | 138 | 369 |
| test | 40 | **145 (this is what you submit)** | – |

The buildings come from four sources:
- **Swiss Dwellings:** multi-floor residential buildings.
- **ResPlan:** single-floor homes.
- **OpenStreetMap indoor data for Munich:** TUM buildings, Munich Airport Terminal 2, Pasing Arcaden and others.
- **Procedural:** generated factories (production halls with machines, loading docks, office blocks) and campus buildings (lecture halls, labs, cores with stairs and lifts).

Test procedural buildings use layouts that train never sees: bigger halls, L-shaped wings, basements and more cores.

---

## 3. Data format

### Conventions

- **Units:** all coordinates are **metres** in a local frame, x to the right and y up.
- **One XY frame per building.** All floors share it, so floors stack. One exception: some Swiss Dwellings floors are centred per floor rather than aligned.
- **Floors:** `level` is an integer: 0 is the ground floor, -1 the first basement, 1 the first upper floor.
- **Outside:** an opening whose `space_ids` contain `"outside"` is an entrance.
- **Synthetic parts:** `synthetic: true` marks things this dataset added that weren't in the source data. Examples are recovered stair halls in Swiss Dwellings, lifts mapped only as a point in OSM, and doors guessed where OSM had none.

### `building.json`

}
```

Notes:
- **Space names and refs:** `name` usually includes the room number (`ref`). Refs are unique per building for generated and Swiss/ResPlan buildings. OSM refs come from the map, and a few rooms share names such as "WC".
- **Room types** include: `bedroom`, `living_room`, `kitchen`, `bathroom`, `toilet`, `storage`, `corridor`, `balcony`, `stairwell`, `lift`, `office`, `meeting_room`, `seminar_room`, `lecture_hall`, `lab`, `makerspace`, `library`, `server_room`, `technical_room`, `lobby`, `canteen`, `shop`, `print_room`, `locker_room`, `production_zone`, `additive_zone`, `assembly_zone`, `warehouse_zone`, `logistics_zone`, `quality_lab` and `generic_room` (an OSM room with no type tag).
- **Door widths:** `width_m` matters for moving wide loads such as trolleys, pallets or beds. Swiss Dwellings and ResPlan widths come from the drawings. Procedural doors are 0.9 m for offices, 1.1 m for lifts, 1.2 m for labs, seminar rooms, meeting rooms, libraries, toilets and stairwells, and 1.6 m double doors for halls, storage, server and technical rooms. OSM doors default to 0.9 m.
- **Step-free:** `step_free: false` means steps, such as a stair connector or an entrance with steps.
- **Stairs and lifts:** stairs join their stop spaces floor to floor in the order of their levels. A lift joins every pair of its stops, because you ride it without getting out on the floors in between.
- **Asset names** are unique within a building, e.g. `Desk 2.03-B` is the second desk in room 2.03.

### `equipment.csv`

`asset_id, name, type, category, source, building_id, floor_level, floor_name, space_id, space_name, room_ref, room_type, x_m, y_m, width_m, depth_m, rotation_deg`. This is the same information as `assets` in `building.json`, flattened.

### `manifest.csv`

`building_id, split, source, group_id, name, license, floors, levels, spaces, rooms, openings, connectors, assets, has_stairs, has_lift, has_step_free_entrance, questions, path`. `path` is relative to `data/`. `group_id` prevents leakage between splits: buildings from one site are all in the same split.

### The route model behind the expected answers

Route lengths in the answers follow the same rules the judges grade with, so your router reproduces them if you build the same graph:

- **Nodes:** one per space, at shapely's `representative_point()` of its polygon (repaired with `buffer(0)` if invalid), plus one per opening at its `position`.
- **Walking inside a space:** every pair of the space's nodes (its centre point and each of its openings) is joined by the shortest walk inside the space that stays **15 cm off the walls** and goes **round corners, never through them**. That walk is computed on `polygon.buffer(-0.15)`, through a visibility graph of the start, the end and the corners of that shrunken outline (a segment counts as clear if `buffer(0.02)` of the shrunken outline covers it). An opening "lands" 30 cm inside each space (the nearest point of `polygon.buffer(-0.30)`), and the step from the opening to its landing is added. So a corridor you only pass through is walked door to door, not via its centre. Edge lengths are rounded to 3 decimals.
- **Furniture and machines** are not obstacles. A route to an item ends in the room or bay that holds it.
- **Stairs:** 2 m of walking per metre climbed. **Lifts:** 15 m for waiting and doors, once per ride however many floors it passes, plus 1 m per metre climbed. The height is the difference between the two floors' `elevation_m`. Stairs and lifts join the spaces' centre points.
- **Step-free routing** drops every stair and every opening with `step_free: false`.
- **Closures:** a closed stair, lift, opening or room can't be used at all.
- **No way round the outside:** an entrance leads out of the building, not into another part of it. If two parts of a building only meet outside, there is no route between them, and the expected answer is `reachable: false`.
- **Parallel connections:** a stair and a lift can join the same two spaces, and two doors the same two rooms. Keep both; a simple graph would drop one.

These rules changed in 1.1.0; see `CHANGELOG.md`.

`starter_agent/building_map.py` implements exactly this model.

## 4. Questions

### Warm-up questions (`questions_basic.jsonl`, train and dev)

One search or one route each. Every line is `{"id", "building_id", "kind", "question", "answer"}`:

| Kind | Example | Answer fields |
|---|---|---|
| `locate` | "Where is the coordinate measuring machine?" | `asset_id`, `space_id`, `space_name`, `floor_level`, `position` |
| `count` | "How many chair items are on the floor 2?" | `count`, `asset_type`, `floor_level` |
| `route` | "How do I get from Office 0.30 (Ground floor) to Office 0.46 (Ground floor)?" | `from_space_id`, `to_space_id`, `optimal_length_m`, `space_path` (every space passed through, in order), `element_path` (the openings, stairs and lifts used), or `reachable: false` |
| `route_step_free` | "Is there a step-free route from … to …?" | Same as route, or `reachable: false` |
| `route_with_closure` | "Lift 1 is closed for maintenance. How do I get from … to …?" | Route fields plus `closed_element_id`, or `reachable: false` |
| `tour` | "Starting at …, visit … then … in this order." | `stops`, `optimal_length_m`, `legs` (one route per leg), or `reachable: false` |

### Benchmark questions (`questions.jsonl`; this is what is scored)

There are two groups.

- **Plan facts.** These need facts that a simple search-and-route agent never looks at, mainly **room areas** (from the polygons) and **door widths**. Most combine them with routing, step-free constraints or reachability.
- **Spatial reasoning.** These need the geometry itself: how floors stack in 3D, which walls rooms share, where room centres are, and what a change to the building would do across a whole floor. Exposing one more field isn't enough; your agent has to reason with polygons, coordinates and elevations.

| Kind | Example |
|---|---|
| `largest_room` | "Which is the largest kitchen on the floor 1, and how big is it in m²?" |
| `floor_area_total` | "Facilities want the total floor area of every office on the ground floor added together. How many square metres is that?" |
| `errand` | "I'm in Server room 0.42. I need to grab a stove from the room that has one closest to me, then carry it to the largest meeting room on the floor 1. I can carry it on the stairs. How far will I walk in total, in metres?" |
| `wide_delivery_count` | "I'm moving a 1.1 m wide trolley. It can't go on stairs or steps (lifts are fine), and every door it passes through must be at least 1.1 m wide. It arrives through the entrance into Lobby 0.01. Into how many rooms on the floor 2 can it be delivered?" |
| `step_free_reachable_count` | "Lift 1 is out of service. A wheelchair user comes in through the entrance into …. How many rooms on the floor 3 can they still reach?" |
| `room_stacked` | "There's water dripping from the ceiling in Office 0.29 (Ground floor). Which room is directly above it?" or "A washing machine is leaking onto the floor of Bathroom 2.04 (Floor 2). Which room directly below it will the water reach?" |
| `shared_walls_count` | "We're soundproofing Server room 1.14 (Floor 1). How many other rooms on that floor share a wall with it? Count every room whose wall runs along it for at least 1 m, with or without a door between them; corridors, stairwells and lifts don't count." |
| `straight_line_3d` | "We're planning a wireless sensor link between Lab 0.12 (Ground floor) and Office 3.07 (Floor 3). What is the straight-line distance in metres between the centres of the two rooms (each room's floor-plan centroid, at its floor's elevation)?" |
| `what_if_door` | "What if we add a door between Corridor 0.01 and Lecture hall 0.21 (Ground floor), in the middle of the wall they share? How many rooms on the floor 3 would then have a shorter walk out of the building, to their nearest entrance, by more than 1 m?" |

Precise definitions for the spatial questions:
- **Directly above / below:** the space on the next floor up or down whose outline covers most of this room's outline. These questions only use buildings whose floors share one XY frame (procedural and OSM).
- **Sharing a wall:** at least 1 m of one room's outline runs within 0.35 m of the other room's outline (walls have thickness).
- **Room centre:** the centroid of the room polygon, at the floor's `elevation_m`.
- **What-if door:** placed at the middle of the shared wall, and walked like any other door, between any two rooms, halls or corridors. The question is about a different floor than the door's. "Walk out of the building" is the route-model distance (section 3) to the nearest entrance.

Each question ends with an answer instruction such as *"Finish with a line 'Answer: <number>'"*.

**Train and dev lines** also contain `skill`, the `inputs` behind the question, and the `answer`. Study them, and use them to test your tools.

**Test lines** contain only `id`, `building_id`, `kind` and `question`.

The answers are well defined. The right room always beats the runner-up by a clear margin, every constraint actually changes the answer, and the largest room is never simply the room with the most furniture. Don't hard-code anything: the questions are generated, and new ones work the same way.

## 5. Quick start

You need Python 3.12+ and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (or pip), plus an Anthropic API key.

```bash
uv sync
cp .env.example .env        # then put your key in .env
uv run --env-file .env python -m starter_agent data/dev/proc-factory-dev-003
```

Measure yourself on **dev** before you touch the test set:

```bash
# warm-up questions, tools only, free:
uv run python -m starter_agent.evaluate data/dev --oracle
# benchmark questions with the starter agent (uses credits; about $0.10–0.25 per question):
uv run --env-file .env python -m benchmark.evaluate data/dev --per-kind 3
# your own agent:
uv run --env-file .env python -m benchmark.evaluate data/dev --agent my_agent:answer
```

`--agent module:function` takes a function `answer(building_directory: Path, question_text: str) -> str` that returns your agent's full reply.

The starter agent scores **under 5% on the benchmark questions**. That is deliberate: its tools don't expose room areas, door widths or reachability, and it shows you where to start. See `starter_agent/README.md` for how it works and ideas to extend it.

---

## 6. Submission format

Submit **one CSV file** with exactly these two columns:

| Column | Content |
|---|---|
| `question_id` | The `id` of a test question, e.g. `osm-way363805324-H01` |
| `answer` | Your agent's **full reply** to that question. It may run over several lines, as long as it is quoted the normal CSV way. |

```csv
question_id,answer
proc-campus-test-000-H01,"The largest seminar room on the ground floor is Seminar room 0.32.
Answer: Seminar room 0.32, 61.4 m²"
proc-campus-test-000-H02,"I added up the 12 offices on floor 1.
Answer: 214.7"
```

Writing the file is easiest with the evaluator. It runs your agent on every test question and saves the CSV:

```bash
uv run --env-file .env python -m benchmark.evaluate data/test --agent my_agent:answer --submission-csv team_<name>.csv
```

`data/test/submission_template.csv` lists every test id, if you would rather fill it in another way. The file must be UTF-8 with a header row and at most 5 MB.

### How it is scored

Only the **last line of the reply that starts with `Answer:`** counts. `**Answer:**` in Markdown is fine.

| Answer type | Correct when |
|---|---|
| A room (`largest_room`) | The answer line names the expected room by its number or full name, **before** any runner-up room, and includes the area in m² within **±5%** |
| A distance in metres (`errand`) | The answer line holds **exactly one number**, within **±1%** (at least ±1 m) of the optimal length |
| An area in m² (`floor_area_total`) | Exactly one number, within **±5%** |
| A count (`wide_delivery_count`, `step_free_reachable_count`, `shared_walls_count`, `what_if_door`) | Exactly one number, **exactly** right |
| A room (`room_stacked`) | The answer line names the expected room, before any runner-up room |
| A 3D distance (`straight_line_3d`) | Exactly one number, within **±2%** |

A reply with no `Answer:` line is wrong. So is an answer line with a range or several numbers ("between 92 and 108 m"). Missing questions count as wrong. Rows with unknown ids are ignored, and if an id appears twice the first row counts. Your score is the share of the 145 test questions answered correctly. Judges also see the result per question kind.

`benchmark/score.py` is the exact scorer the judges use. Run it on dev to check your formatting.

## 7. Rules and tips

- **Generated answers only:** answers must come from your agent running on the data, not from hand-labelling test questions.
- **The Sunday building** arrives in the same format. Anything you hard-code to the test buildings will fail there.
- **Start small:** get the route graph right first (section 3). Check it against the warm-up answers on dev; the route lengths should match to the centimetre.
- **Expose the data:** give your agent tools for what the plans actually contain (areas, door widths, adjacency, reachability, positions), not only search.
- **Watch your costs:** each question can take many tool calls. Keep tool results compact, and use prompt caching for the building context.

## 8. Licences

The data comes under several licences: CC BY 4.0 (Swiss Dwellings, ResPlan), ODbL 1.0 (the OpenStreetMap buildings) and CC0 (procedural). See `ATTRIBUTION.md`. If you publish anything built from the OSM buildings, it must stay under the ODbL and credit OpenStreetMap contributors.
